# Conda Environments

These environments were used to create an <b>Anaconda Environment</b> to execute the code in this repository.
These environments are not necessary to run the code, but contain a list of required packages and their versions and <i>Anaconda</i> automatically downloads them.

You can recreate the environment using ether one of these files.

## How to?

First, you need to download and install <i>Anaconda</i> from here: https://www.anaconda.com/

Refer to the official documentation if you want to learn how to set up your own environment, based on an environment file:
